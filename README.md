# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is critical to project management to ensure deadlines are met and software product is delivered on time. Project managers can ensure this by;
Defining clear project objectives and scope – Before starting to build any project, you need to have clearly outlined documentation of project objectives, scope, deliverables, success criteria, and achievable timelines to avoid what is called scope creep, which is when project objectives or deliverables change within the development phase so as to avoid things like project deadlines not being met and additional costs that may cost overrun which may lead to project failure.
1.	Create a realistic budget and schedule- Create a budget depending on the available resources and stakeholders and sponsors that may be available. Use the CPM to determine the critical path method of the project so that you may know projects that need to completed first and those that will use a lot of resoources . By using this as a PM , you can adjust accordingly.
2.	Communicate effectively and frequently- Commmunication with your team members is very key. Get regular feedbacks, have regular meetings with your team just to ensure that everyone is on the same page and no one is left behind.
3.	Manage risks and changes; have mitigation and contingency plans for managing risks. Identify and assess potential risks that may occur and come up with a plan for how to solve them. Create a risk register template. Risk identification – identify the risks that may affect your project
Determine the likelihood and impact of the risks
Find solutions for each risk
Monitor your risk assessment regularly
You can use the RISK REGISTER TEMPLATE, SWOT Analysis, and Brainstorming.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control enables team members to stay within the project scope and budget. It determines which areas of the project cost more and the expenses incurred in those areas.
Some strategies a Project Manager can use include
Planning your budget effectively: As a project manager, ensure a realistic budget to ensure resources are assigned effectively. Ensure you know the number of team members you will require for the entire project, estimated time the project will take to complete and the materials you will need for the project. When creating a plan , give your project a room to expand if needed especially when calculating the time and materials needed for the project to complete.
Monitor and track all expenses during the entire project – Set project milestones so that at the end of each milestone, you can access your expenditure and determine whether your project is still within project scope.
Use change control systems ; these are set of steps that manages any changes that may come from stakeholders while the project is in progress, this helps prevents scope creep.
Manage your time- Staying within the project timeline is key to ensure no budget overrun. When the total time to complete a project increases, the budget also increases.
Track Earned Value- Keeping track of your earned value can help you predict the final outcome of the entire project, Create a Project estimation template to track your Earned Value.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
In terms of flexibility, the waterfall methodology is highly inflexible. Once a phase is completed, no additional features can be added, unlike Agile methodology, which is highly flexible, and changes can be made at every stage of the development cycle.
Waterfall uses an approach where each phase of the SDLC must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Agile methodology is iterative, and the product is delivered in small increments with continuous planning, Testing, and feedback;-continuous Testing throughout the SDLC process.
Limited user involvement throughout the Waterfall SDLC until the testing phase compared to agile, which allows continuous user involvement and feedback
Single Release at the end potentially longer time-to-market compared to agile which has gradual releases quicker time to market for incremental features.
In Waterfall model, less adaptable changes may be costly and time consuming compared to Agile which is highly adaptable to changing requirements.
The waterfall model is sequential and linear compared to agile, which is cyclical and incremental.
Advantages of Waterfall Methodology.
Clear structure and documentation
Easy to manage due to its rigidity
Disadvantages
Difficult to accommodate any changes
Testing occurs late in the process
Advantages of Agile
Quick response to changes
Regular customer feedback
Improved team collaboration
Disadvantages
Less predictability
Requires significant customer involvement

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is suited for projects that may require flexibility, collaboration, and the ability to respond to changing requirements. For example, an agile methodology is required to develop an e-commerce app like Jumia Kenya. 
The Waterfall is suited for large projects where a structured and sequential approach is necessary, projects with well-defined requirements, e.g., aerospace

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards**
Requirement analysis- Clearly define quality standards and the functional and non-functional requirements.
Code reviews and peer programming -This plan should include review, Testing, and documentation activities, such as using GitHub pull requests to review code before merging and using Lint in Android Studio to check for code quality issues.
Perform Testing: Testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing ensures your app works perfectly. Use Unit Tests and Junit to test individual classes or methods. UI tests using Expresso to automate UI interactions
Continuous Integration and Deployment – Automating builds and tests ensures stable releases, e.g., Firebase test labs.
Monitor and measure
Improve Continuously
Importance 
Reduces bugs SQA ensures that the developers find bugs and errors at the early stages of software development.
Improves user experience
Saves development time and costs 
Ensures security Software quality assurance helps organizations ensure that their application is efficient, secure, and trustworthy.
Ensures scalability 

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope gives you a clear picture of your project objectives, the deliverables, the overall budget, and the timeline to finish the entire project.  A WBS is where you break a project from the top into smaller manageable chunks. It sets a clear framework for project planning, execution, and control. Tools used include the Gantt chart, Kanban
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Developing a detailed project schedule includes having a clear visual representation of the project life cycle, the tasks to be achieved with a deadline, and the progress of the project. Gantt chart is used to provide a clear representation of the whole project life cycle. It lists tasks along a timeline, showing timeframes, dependencies, and progress.
Benefits include
Prioritization
Tracking
Resource Management
Risk management
Stakeholder Satisfaction Communication and Cost Management
